There is one constant result: people die from exposure to the elements, from direct personal violence, from the loss of their homes to quick flowing water or mud or falling buildings. Finding shelter in a rainy environment, at night, is extremely difficult.  Living exposed to weather conditions, particularly when the temperature falls below 50 degrees F., especially for a family, is beyond stressful.

Meal-Brick can arrive full folded to thus serve as components of construction (with a house-shelter capable of being assembled/erected within 4 hours thus providing overall shelter in a 24 hour period for 72 people. The cost of each PLASTIC BRICK, manufactured in factories by 100,000 per day shall be supplemented by the World Bank and Contributing Countries @ 1 US Dollar/Brick. The Bricks may also be delivered with folding internal compartments and rigidity structures already full of bottles of water, packets of crackers, Meal-Ready-to-Eat, Basic Medicines, Water Purifying tablets, and anything else that could be packed into the 12\"\" x 12\"\"x12\"\" (or smaller cubic, rectangular, square) container interior space.

Images of Meal-Brick both in a Foldable and in a Filled state are attached.

Further Sleep-Safe is set up on Plasticized/Metal Rigging so as to achieve an assembled shape of the Abrams Battle Tank Turret so as to further retard projectiles and shrapnel.  Sleep-Safe may also be hung along walls or openings to provide further protection with each such Sleep-Safe covering measuring 6' x 8'.  With the use of heavy zippers, Sleep-Safe may be re-configured into a ground covering such as the covering over a Fox-Hole. Further, the cover may be reconfigured using the Zippers as a PERSONNEL PONCHO so that individual Sleep-Safe covers become wearable individual protection for soldiers or combattants. Solutions: There are no solutions available for those who have suffered natural calamity or those continuing to suffer the effects of warring countries. Meal-Brick will save lives the very day they are dropped or delivered for use anywhere. They are designed to take instant advantage of any venue in which they are needed.  People will instantly understand how they are to be used and their contents will save lives immediately.  Sleep-Safe(R, Pat Pend) can similarly be air-dropped and will provide instant life-saving protection.

It demonstrates a strong focus on reusing and repurposing materials to create practical solutions, while also providing specific details for implementation. However, the long-term environmental impact of relying extensively on plastic materials should be carefully assessed and managed.\n"
